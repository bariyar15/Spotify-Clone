# Spotify-Clone

This is the Spotify Clone using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in frontend.
All the functions like playing song, controlling volume, next, previous, play and pause features are there in it
I also hosted this website in webhostmost which gives free hosting upto 125Mb.

Also, if anyone trying to preview in local host, add a folder "Song" and inside that another folder "ncs" and add your songs of choice
You can create as many folders you want, but don't foget to add a file .htacess which you have to include in the "Song" folder

Thank You!
